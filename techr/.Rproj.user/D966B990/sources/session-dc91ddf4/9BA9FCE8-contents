## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

# Running our Example

### Import Library

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

### Plot Cars Dataset w/ Trends

```{r}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = 'loess', formula = 'y ~ x') +
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm", col = "red", formula = 'y ~ x')
```

### Now we create the Linear Model

```{r}
# The trend is not very linear, but for simplicity, lets assume that it is 
# "linear-ish". Fit a linear model and obtain the coeffcients of the model
# that uses horsepower to predict fuel economy. 
tlm <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
summary(tlm)
```

### Finally, present info in $\LaTeX$

Use LaTeX to create a model that has the following form:

$$ \hat{y} = b_0 + b_1\cdot h_p $$

where $b_0$ and $b_1$ are the model coefficients.

Using values from our regression, we get

$$
\hat{y} = `r tlm$coefficients[1]` + `r tlm$coefficients[2]` \cdot h_p 
$$
